2. Lower £27000.0 debt to improve net worth of £-24500.0.

Okay, based on the provided financial metrics, here are 3 financial improvement suggestions:

1.  **Aggressively Tackle Debt:** With a massive debt burden and an extremely high DTI, prioritizing debt repayment is crucial. Explore options like debt consolidation, balance transfers (if applicable despite the high debt), or a debt management plan. Focus on high-interest debts first.

2.  **Maintain High Savings Rate & Re-evaluate Investment Strategy:** The high savings rate is excellent. Continue this aggressive saving, but also consider re-evaluating where those savings are held. Given the negative net worth, prioritize more conservative, liquid investments to build a stronger financial foundation before venturing into higher-risk options.

3.  **Seek Professional Financial Advice:** Given the complexity of the financial situation (high debt, negative net worth), seeking guidance from a qualified financial advisor is highly recommended. They can help create a personalized debt repayment strategy, optimize savings and investments, and develop a comprehensive financial plan.

Okay, here are 3 financial improvement suggestions based on your metrics:

1.  **Aggressively Pay Down Debt (Despite Low DTI):** Even with a low DTI of 9.99%, eliminating debt provides a guaranteed return equal to the interest rate. Given your substantial savings, consider allocating a larger sum to eliminate the £543 debt quickly.

2.  **Optimize Savings Allocation:** With a very high savings rate of 9835.2% and significant savings (£534543), evaluate if your savings are optimally allocated. Consider diversifying investments to potentially increase returns, while still maintaining a comfortable emergency fund.

3.  **Negotiate Salary Increase:** Even with strong financials, consistently seeking salary increases is beneficial. Research industry benchmarks for your role and experience to identify potential for salary growth. Use your strong financial position as leverage to take calculated career risks that could lead to higher compensation.
